# Case Study 1 - Analyzing Job Market Data In Power BI
The aim of the project was to determine the trends in data science job market.
All of the metrics were broken down by job title, job position level, company name, company size, company industry, and Year.
No. of years of experience, no. of job postings, job skills by job titles, job skills by industry, income by job position, company sizes were some of the variables that were focused on.
Most interest findings for me were:
Data Engineers had the highest number of job postings. In most of these postings, three skills (AWS, Azure, Cloud, Python, ETL) were required.
SQL was the most learnt job skill in the data science job market.

# Case Study 2 - Competitor Sales Analysis in Power BI
The aim of the project was to draw a whole picture of the said company in terms of its sales, market share, and growth percentages based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
Date (Year, Quarter, Month, Day), Country, Manufacturer
The results were compared with the metrics from other competitor companies.
It is worth noting that the most important part of the project was to determine the key influencers of revenue, 
which were discovered to be the locality at which the product was being sold (urban/rural), the population that it was being sold to (youth), and the actual unit that was being sold (Lignum UC - 24).

# Case Study 3 - HR Analytics in Power BI
The aim of the project was three-fold:
Explain the demographics of the employee base to the upper management.
Explain key indicators (environment satisfaction, job satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, work-life balance) to the upper management.
Explain the differences between self-ratings and manager-ratings by period.
Explain attrition rates (by department, hiring date, tenure, travel frequency, and overtime requirement).

# Case Study 4 - Accounting and Finance Analytics in Power BI
The aim of this project was to highlight differences in budget and expenditures based on departments, divisions, cost centers, funds, and time. 
It was so that the business could tackle areas which were going over budget, subsequently reducing costs and increasing profits.
